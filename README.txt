|ABOUT|
-------
-> Clean up valid files (.txt, .py, etc...) by removing lines that meet certain conditions (empty line, commented line, etc...)

-> Useful for you if:
  -> You're the exuberant sort of programmer who excessively adds empty lines for separating sections of programs (me)
  -> You're confident you don't need any of your commented code after finishing a project (me, too)
  -> You get loads of complaints for leaving random chunks of testing code all around (yup)
  -> You spend significant time cleaning up after your code when trying to submit a presentable copy


-------
|USAGE|
-------
Place the program file <program.py> in the directory of files you want to clean up
Double click the program! It's that simple! The successfully cleaned files will end up in a folder <CleanedOutput> in the same directory
